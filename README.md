# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

[Task 1] This project for Music curation and analysis will create a database of 3 different piano based songs. These will range from simple sheet music, intermediate to more advanced. Over the next 11 weeks a dataset will be created from these transcribed scores, as well as other tracks used to complete different tasks.
