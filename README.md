# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

[Task 1]

The theme for this dataset began with 3 piano songs in various difficulties
this includes, the can can by Jacques Offenbach, Dark Blue by Jacks Mannequin and
Fur Elise by Ludwig van Beethoven. In that order these songs are from beginner to advanced.
Through the tasks set out each week these three songs have been analysed.

After week 5 the theme developed into a more random collections of songs for analysis of different genres.

Currently there are no places that I am aware of that bring this selection of songs together for analysis.
