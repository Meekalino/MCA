   <feature>
      <name>Number of Common Pitches</name>
      <description>Number of unique pitches that account individually for at least 9% of all notes. Enharmonic equivalents are grouped together for the purpose of this calculation.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Number of Common Pitch Classes</name>
      <description>Number of pitch classes that account individually for at least 20% of all notes. Enharmonic equivalents are grouped together for the purpose of this calculation.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Variability</name>
      <description>Standard deviation of the MIDI pitches of all pitched notes in the piece. Provides a measure of how close the pitches as a whole are to the mean pitch.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Class Variability</name>
      <description>Standard deviation of the pitch classes (where 0 corresponds to C, 1 to C#/Db, etc.) of all pitched notes in the piece. Provides a measure of how close the pitch classes as a whole are to the mean pitch class.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>First Pitch</name>
      <description>The MIDI pitch value of the first note in the piece. If there are multiple notes with simultaneous attacks at the beginning of the piece, then the one with the lowest pitch is selected. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>
      <is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Last Pitch</name>
      <description>The MIDI pitch value of the last note in the piece. If there are multiple notes with simultaneous attacks at the end of the piece, then the one with the lowest pitch is selected. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Total Number of Notes</name>
      <description>Total number of notes, including both pitched and unpitched notes.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Range of Rhythmic Values</name>
      <description>A measure of the difference between the shortest rhythmic values and the longest rhythmic values in the music. Measured in number of bins in the Rhythmic Value Histogram separating the first (i.e. the one with the shortest rhythmic value) non-zero bin and the last (i.e. the one with the longest rhythmic value) non-zero bin.</description>
